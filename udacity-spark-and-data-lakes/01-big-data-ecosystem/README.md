# Introduction to Big Data Ecosystem

Early efforts at processing large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data led to the development of Hadoop. Hadoop incorporates two key components:

- The Hadoop Distributed File System (or HDFS) provides distributed storage with high-throughput access to data.

- MapReduce provides a way to conduct massive parallel processing for large amounts of data.
The next step in the evolution was Apache Spark.

Spark built on the ideas of Hadoop and provided multiple programming APIs for processing data as well as providing an interactive interface for iteratively developing data engineering and data science solutions.

Hadoop and Spark have led to the development and popularity of data lakes to process large amounts of both structured and unstructured data.

Finally, the latest step in the evolution of big data ecosystems is the lake house architecture. Lake house seeks to combine the strengths of both data lakes and data warehouses.

Data warehouses are based on specific and explicit data structures that allow for highly performant business intelligence and analytics but they do not perform well with unstructured data.

Data lakes are capable of ingesting massive amounts of both structured and unstructured data with Hadoop and Spark providing processing on top of these datasets.

Data lakes have several shortcomings that grew out of their flexibility. They are unable to support transactions and perform poorly with changing datasets. Data governance became difficult due to the unstructured nature of these systems.

Modern lakehouse architectures seek to combine the strengths of data warehouses and data lakes into a single, powerful architecture.

# The Hadoop Ecosystem

### Hadoop Vocabulary

- Hadoop - an ecosystem of tools for big data storage and data analysis. Hadoop is an older system than Spark but is still used by many companies. The major difference between Spark and Hadoop is how they use memory. Hadoop writes intermediate results to disk whereas Spark tries to keep data in memory whenever possible. This makes Spark faster for many use cases.

- Hadoop MapReduce - a system for processing and analyzing large data sets in parallel.

- Hadoop YARN - a resource manager that schedules jobs across a cluster. The manager keeps track of what computer resources are available and then assigns those resources to specific tasks.

- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) - a big data storage system that splits data into chunks and stores the chunks across a cluster of computers.

As Hadoop matured, other tools were developed to make Hadoop easier to work with. These tools included:

- Apache Pig - a SQL-like language that runs on top of Hadoop MapReduce
- Apache Hive - another SQL-like interface that runs on top of Hadoop MapReduce


# How is Spark related to Hadoop?

Spark, which is the main focus of this course, is another big data framework. Spark contains libraries for data analysis, machine learning, graph analysis, and streaming live data. Spark is generally faster than Hadoop. This is because Hadoop writes intermediate results to disk whereas Spark tries to keep intermediate results in memory whenever possible.

The Hadoop ecosystem includes a distributed file storage system called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Spark, on the other hand, does not include a file storage system. You can use Spark on top of HDFS but you do not have to. Spark can read in data from other sources as well.


# MapReduce

MapReduce is a programming technique for manipulating large data sets. "Hadoop MapReduce" is a specific implementation of this programming technique.

The technique works by first dividing up a large dataset and distributing the data across a cluster. In the map step, each data is analyzed and converted into a (key, value) pair. Then these key-value pairs are shuffled across the cluster so that all keys are on the same machine. In the reduce step, the values with the same keys are combined together.

While Spark doesn't implement MapReduce, you can write Spark programs that behave in a similar way to the map-reduce paradigm. In the next section, you will run through a code example.


# The Spark Cluster

When we talk about distributed computing, we generally refer to a big computational job executing across a cluster of nodes. Each node is responsible for a set of operations on a subset of the data. At the end, we combine these partial results to get the final answer. But how do the nodes know which task to run and demote order? Are all nodes equal? Which machine are you interacting with when you run your code?

Most computational frameworks are organized into a master-worker hierarchy:

- The master node is responsible for orchestrating the tasks across the cluster
- Workers are performing the actual computations

There are four different modes to setup Spark:

- Local mode: In this case, everything happens on a single machine. So, while we use spark's APIs, we don't really do any distributed computing. The local mode can be useful to learn syntax and to prototype your project.

The other three modes are distributed and declare a cluster manager. The cluster manager is a separate process that monitors available resources and makes sure that all machines are responsive during the job. There are three different options of cluster managers:

- Spark's own Standalone Customer Manager. In Spark's Standalone mode there is a Driver Process. If you open a Spark shell, either Python or Scala, you are directly interacting with the driver program. It acts as the master and is responsible for scheduling tasks

- YARN from the Hadoop project

- Another open-source manager from UC Berkeley's AMPLab Coordinators.

# Spark Use Cases

### Spark Use Cases

- Data Analytics
- Machine Learning
- Streaming
- Graph Analytics

### You Don't Always Need Spark

Spark is meant for big data sets that cannot fit on one computer. But you don't need Spark if you are working on smaller data sets. In the cases of data sets that can fit on your local computer, there are many other options out there you can use to manipulate data such as:

- AWK - a command line tool for manipulating text files
- R - a programming language and software environment for statistical computing
- Python data libraries, which include Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and scikit-learn among other libraries

Sometimes, you can still use pandas on a single, local machine even if your data set is only a little bit larger than memory. Pandas can read data in chunks. Depending on your use case, you can filter the data and write out the relevant parts to disk.

If the data is already stored in a relational database such as MySQL or Postgres, you can leverage SQL to extract, filter and aggregate the data. If you would like to leverage pandas and SQL simultaneously, you can use libraries such as SQLAlchemy, which provides an abstraction layer to manipulate SQL tables with generative Python expressions.

The most commonly used Python Machine Learning library is scikit-learn. It has a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering, as well as utilities for preprocessing data, fine tuning model parameters and testing their results. However, if you want to use more complex algorithms - like deep learning - you'll need to look further. TensorFlow and PyTorch are currently popular packages.

### Spark's Limitations

Spark Streamingâ€™s latency is at least 500 milliseconds since it operates on micro-batches of records, instead of processing one record at a time. Native streaming tools such as Storm, Apex, or Flink can push down this latency value and might be more suitable for low-latency applications. Flink and Apex can be used for batch computation as well, so if you're already using them for stream processing, there's no need to add Spark to your stack of technologies.

Another limitation of Spark is its selection of machine learning algorithms. Currently, Spark only supports algorithms that scale linearly with the input data size. In general, deep learning is not available either, though there are many projects that integrate Spark with Tensorflow and other deep learning tools.

### Hadoop versus Spark

The Hadoop ecosystem is a slightly older technology than the Spark ecosystem. In general, Hadoop MapReduce is slower than Spark because Hadoop writes data out to disk during intermediate steps. However, many big companies, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, started using Big Data early and built their infrastructure around the Hadoop ecosystem.

While Spark is great for iterative algorithms, there is not much of a performance boost over Hadoop MapReduce when doing simple counting. Migrating legacy code to Spark, especially on hundreds of nodes that are already in production, might not be worth the cost for the small performance boost.

### Beyond Spark for Storing and Processing Big Data

Keep in mind that Spark is not a data storage system, and there are a number of tools besides Spark that can be used to process and analyze large datasets.

Sometimes it makes sense to use the power and simplicity of SQL on big data. For these cases, a new class of databases, know as NoSQL and NewSQL, have been developed.

For example, you might hear about newer database storage systems like HBase or Cassandra. There are also distributed SQL engines like Impala and Presto. Many of these technologies use query syntax that you are likely already familiar with based on your experiences with Python and SQL.


# Data Lakes

Data lakes are an evolution beyond data warehouses and allow an organization to ingest massive amounts of both structured and unstructured data into storage.

With a data warehouse, you can imagine lining up all the data as it is ingested much like goods stacked on a shelf in a warehouse, which are pulled off in an orderly manner. Data has to be structured going in and out of the warehouse.

A data lake on the other hand, pours all of the data into a single repository, ready to be consumed by whoever and wherever they need.

### Key Features of Data Lakes

One of the key differences between data warehouses and data lakes is the inclusion of structured versus unstructured data.

Data warehouses consist of only highly structured data that is suitable for business intelligence and reporting needs.

Often data science and machine learning efforts need access to all data, including unstructured data.

Data lakes provide the ability to serve up both types of data from a single data store

### The key features of data lakes include:

- Lower costs associated with using big data tools for ETL / ELT operations.
- Data lakes provide schema-on-read rather than schema-on-write which lowers the cost and work of ingesting large amounts of data.
- Data lakes provide support for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.


# Data Lakes, Lakehouse, and Spark

### Apache Spark: Data Engineering, Analytics, or Science?

By now, you have heard of Apache Spark. Depending on where you first heard of it, you might view Spark as a:

- Data engineering tool
- Data analytics tool
- Data science tool

Which is it? The answer is all three. Depending on what you are doing, Apache Spark can fill all three of these roles.

### Apache Spark, Data Lakes, and Lakehouse

Apache Spark can be used to perform data engineering tasks for building both data lakes and lakehouse architectures.

Most often, these data engineering tasks consist of ETL or ELT tasks. As a reminder, E stands of Extract, T stands for Transform and L stands for Load.

Apache Spark allows the data engineer to perform these tasks, along with raw data ingestion using the language of their choice with support for Python, R, SQL, Scala, and Java.


# Data Lakehouse

### Data Lakehouse Architecture

Data lakes were a huge step forward from data warehouses but some of their key features led to weaknesses. With the need to ingest a large amount of unstructured data, we lost:

- Atomic transactions: failed production jobs left data in a corrupted state.
- Quality enforcement: inconsistent and therefore unusable data.
- Consistency in data structures: impossible to stream and batch process data while ingesting.

![LAKEHOUSE-ARCHITECTURE](./images/image3.png)

The key innovation of the lakehouse architecture is the creation of a metadata and data governance layer on top of the data lake.

- This creates a pool of raw data as well as a curated set of data.
- This provides the flexibility and benefits we previously saw with data lakes, and it also provides solutions to the weaknesses in data lakes.

### Lakehouse Architecture Features

One of the important features of a lakehouse architecture is the ability to quickly ingest large amounts of data and then incrementally improve the quality of the data. We can think of this process using the colors we often associate with Olympic medals.

![DATA-QUALITY-LEVELS](./images/image4.png)

- Raw ingested data can be considered bronze.
- After some filtering, cleaning, and augmenting, the data can be considered silver.
- Finally, with the addition of business-level aggregates such as you might see with a star schema, data can be considered gold and ready for analytics and reporting needs.

### Differences Between Data Lakes and Lakehouse Architecture

The key difference between data lakes and data lakehouse architectures is the inclusion of the metadata and governance layer.

This is the crucial ingredient that provides atomicity, data quality, and consistency for the underlying data lake.
